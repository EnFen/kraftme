### Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
The following technologies were used in the development and deployment of the KraftMe Marketplace App:
  * Ruby on Rails
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Git/Github
  * Heroku

### Instructions on how to setup, configure and use your App.
A standard user of the site must first proceed to the [KraftMe Marketplace](https://young-scrubland-51531.herokuapp.com), where they will be able to view all available artworks in the KraftMe gallery. Once they have created a user profile and signed up, they will be able to access and participate in the rest of the website, including posting their own artworks for sale, contacting artists, or making a purchase.
At this time, admin level users must request access from the developers, who will set up the account and then provide the user with an appropriate admin level username and password.

## Design documentation


### Design process 
Our group started by brainstorming ideas for the marketplace, and decided to create an Australian only market place, where users can buy and sell their artworks. The application will be a place where people can find local artists, get in contact with them, buy artwork and also have the option to get their own masterpieces out to the public.  
Then we proceeded with doing the ERD, the user stories, and then started the development. We decided on the MVP features so we can prioritise them first and then identify nice-to-have features that we can work on given the timeline given for the assignment. Development was done via pair and solo programming.

### User stories
User stories were written on to cards on our Trello Board. Progress of our project over time, including how user stories were added, modified, and addressed in the project can be seen [here](./docs/trello_boards)

## Details of planning process

### Project plan & timeline
A project plan was developed using the 'Due Date' function on Trello cards as a guide for completing product features.
We had 9 days to complete the project, which progressed according to the following timeline:
  ###### Day One
  * Wireframes
  * ERD Design
  * User Stories
  * Assignment of feature priority for MVP
  * Assignment of due dates for high priority features
  * Git flow set up for all team members
  * Initial deployment of Rails to Heroku
  ###### Day Two - Seven
  * Development of KraftMe app functionality & features
  * Addition of styling (minor)
  * Manual and Automated testing of the application in both development and production environments
  ###### Day Eight - Nine
  * Bugfixes
  * Documentation
  * Presentation preparation
